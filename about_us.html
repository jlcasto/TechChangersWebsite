	<h1>Uyen Ho</h1>
	<p>Howdy! I'm Uyen. I currently live and work in the heart of Baltimore as a Software Engineer for a startup called Fearless. I try to save the world, one line of code at a time. People find me to be an enthusiastic, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills. For the past several years, I have assisted in design, development, integration, and deployment for application software of all sizes. I am fueled by my passion for understanding all aspects of software development. I consider myself a life-long student, eager to build  on my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest technology in the industry. 
	<br> 
	<br>
		I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam but grew up in Baltimore. I am actually plotting an escape. My body is resisting this fluctuation of temperature. It yearns for the crystal-clear water of the Carribean. I might just comply.   
	<br>
	<br>
		I am a food, fitness, and music enthusiast. I love traveling, going to concerts, trying new restaurants and just in general am a fan of trying new things and being open to new experiences and cultures. I spend my little bits of free time teaching middle and high schoolers how to code, endlessly rewatching Friends on Netflix, and just trying to be a somewhat functional member of society. I also have 2 pet shrimp, Bonnie and Clyde. They're easy going and very low maintenance. The only downside is that they're not exactly the cuddliest.  </p>
